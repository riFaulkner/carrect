# gas-consumption
This is a project desinged to require the usage and understanding of many different technologies, while remaining small in scope
and requirements. For this reason some, possibly easier alternatives have been passed on to allow for maximum range of tech. 
  
The App will allow the user to track gas usage over time and save it to a database. To do this there will be two different 
  applications. A front end and backend. The interaction beween the two will be fully REST based.
